Project Overview

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe desktop game built as a Python mini project using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The game is designed for two players who take turns marking spaces on a 3×3 grid, with Player X always going first. The application automatically detects a win by checking all possible winning combinations — horizontal, vertical, and diagonal — and displays a pop-up message to announce the winner or declare a draw when no moves are left. After every game ends, the board resets automatically so players can start a new round without restarting the program. The entire project is contained in a single Python file, making it lightweight, beginner-friendly, and easy to run on any system with Python installed.
